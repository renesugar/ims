# ims

The ims service is designed to assist with performing image transformations on
the fly using either a full Go solution provided by github.com/disintegration/imaging
or a wrapped solution around the popular ImageMagick Library
gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v3/imagick. The latter of course requires that the
imagemagick library is available.
